In the realm of foreign law, scholars will find titles that explore questions of law and legal history specific to Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, and Switzerland, with an especially strong representation of legal works on France from 1800 to 1925. In the field of comparative law, this collection features books that compare more than one legal system, with close inspections of common law and civil law systems as well as Talmudic, Islamic, and indigenous legal systems.

Some of the titles in this collection were conceived and published by men, for women; others, conceived and published by male editors with strong input from female assistant editors or managers; others were conceived and published by women, for women. The strongest suffrage and anti-suffrage writing was done by women for women’s periodicals. Thus a variety of viewpoints are here presented for study.&nbsp;</p><p>This resource is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://byui.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/gdsc/start.do?p=GDSC&amp;u=byuidaho&amp;authCount=1\"><i>Archives Unbound</i></a>&nbsp;collection from Gale.</p>",
